Intro

Hello. We are The Great Supine Protoplasmic Invertebrate Jellies.
For our final project we decided to do a game related to the current covid situation. Initialy 
the plan was to do an informative game for children to learn the guidlines around covid. 
However we couldn't help ourselves, and as the days went on it started leaning more towards 
a satire piece.

The game could be described as a Super Mario clone, but better.

For the project we used Javascript, Node and React. 
Netlify for deployment and travis for CI testing.
I've Just posted a link to our game so you can have a go, it can also be 
found on our GitHub page which is also linked.

Lizzie will now talk to you about how we planned for the project.
