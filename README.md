# Covid Game  

[Build Status]()

Welcome to "our game".
Covid has struck the world. You must now adapt to survive.
Mrs. Morris is in desperate need of milk, but she can not leave her home as she is old and at risk of infection.
You are her only hope of having a cuppa.
Are you up for the challenge?
You must not come within 2 meters of anyone or you will be at risk yourself. 
If you stay too close for too long you will get sick and be placed in quarantine.

## Development Process

Our team used an agile development process with periodic sprints to deliver this game. The client's specification was broken down by our team into user stories which were then assigned to team member pairs. This process allowed us to integrate changes in specification late into development and keep the team running by dividing up dividing up tasks during the sprints. We used a process of branches, pull-request code reviews and continuous integration testing pipelines to keep our code clean and dependendable.

For an insight into our agile process you can view our team's [card wall here]().

We employed extensive domain and database modelling for our application before beginning development as well as diagramming the flow of the application. There are links to our wiki with this planning below:
